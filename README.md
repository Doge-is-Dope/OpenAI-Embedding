### Set up the environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies.

Install the required packages in the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```
